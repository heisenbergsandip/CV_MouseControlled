"CVMouseControl" is a Python project leveraging OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI libraries to enable virtual mouse control through hand gestures. By analyzing hand movements captured via webcam, the system interprets finger signs to simulate mouse actions, offering users an intuitive and hands-free alternative for computer interaction.

To get started, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
- OpenCV: [pip](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)/[conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opencv)
- MediaPipe: [pip](https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/)/[conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mediapipe)
- PyAutoGUI: [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pyautogui/)/[conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyautogui)

Once installed, follow the instructions in the repository to set up and run the CVMouseControl project on your system. Enjoy seamless mouse control with just a wave of your hand!

I controlled the online game by implementing above code of main.py and it was responsive.
